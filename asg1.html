        <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>  
        <dfn>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with properties,composition and behaviour of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building block of the universe.</dfn> 
        <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
        <p>The <mark>Periodic Table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements . Each element is represented by its chemical symbol,such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties. </p>
        <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
        <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction</i>:
        
        </p><p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> -&gt; 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>   

        <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <i>(H<sub>2</sub>)</i> and oxygen gas <i>(O<sub>2</sub>)</i>to from water <i>(H<sub>2</sub>O)</i>.</p>
        <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
        <p><b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reaction. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>

        <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicates the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>Superscripts</sup> represents charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
